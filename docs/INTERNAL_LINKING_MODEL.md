# INTERNAL LINKING MODEL
## Hub-and-Spoke Authority Structure

Goal: Strengthen entity coherence and topical authority.

# CORE HUBS
1. Houston AI Events Hub
2. AI Transformation (Houston)
3. AI Engineering (Houston)
4. CodeAlign
5. Executive AI Office Hours

Each hub must:
- Link outward to supporting content
- Receive internal links from recaps and blog posts

# EVENT LOOP STRUCTURE
Event page → Event recap → Deep dive blog → Case study → Executive memo → Back to hub

No isolated pages.

---

# CASE STUDY LINKING
Each case study should link to:
- Relevant service page
- Related executive memo
- Related event recap
- Executive call booking page

---

# BLOG POST LINKING
Each blog must link to:
- 1 service page
- 1 event recap
- 1 related article

Minimum 3 internal links per article.

# CROSS-DOMAIN RULE
Houston AI Club recap → Links to Amplify deep dive → Links to Leon executive memo → Links back to Houston AI Club hub

Circular authority reinforcement.

# Houston AI Authority Engine

A strategy and operations repository for establishing **Leon Coe** and **Amplify Intelligence** as the dominant AI authority in Houston, Texas.

---

## What This Is

This repo is the operating system for a multi-layer authority-building strategy — not a content vault. It contains the planning docs, templates, and execution infrastructure needed to run a disciplined, enterprise-focused AI authority campaign.

**Three pillars:**
- **Leon Coe** — Human trust anchor and thought leader
- **Amplify Intelligence** — Delivery, proof, and enterprise conversion engine
- **Houston AI Club** — Community convening and visibility layer

## Structure

```

# Session Log — 2026-02-26 — Final Structural Lock-In

## Goal of this session (1–2 sentences)
Implement the technical "spine" of the authority engine by creating schema checklists, SEO maps, and internal linking models.

## Context Pack Used
- MASTER_AUTHORITY_SYSTEM_PLAN.md
- SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md
- EXECUTION_ROADMAP.md

## Actions Taken
- [x] Created `docs/ENTITY_SCHEMA_CHECKLIST.md` for Knowledge Graph optimization.
- [x] Created `docs/SEO_KEYWORD_MAP.md` for Houston-first commercial targeting.
- [x] Created `docs/INTERNAL_LINKING_MODEL.md` for authority reinforcement.
- [x] Created `templates/content-atomization.md` to define derivation rules.

## Decisions Made
- **Decision:** Hybrid dual-authority (Leon + Amplify) is the primary schema target.
- **Rationale:** Maximizes trust (individual) while protecting commercial scalability (firm) in local search results.

## Outputs Created/Modified
- **Files:** ENTITY_SCHEMA_CHECKLIST.md, SEO_KEYWORD_MAP.md, INTERNAL_LINKING_MODEL.md, content-atomization.md

## Next Steps
1. Review SEO keyword map against current site rankings (Baseline).
2. Begin drafting the "Houston-first" commercial page outlines.

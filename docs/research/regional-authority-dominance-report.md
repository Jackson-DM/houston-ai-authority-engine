# Regional AI Authority Dominance Strategy for Leon Coe and Amplify Intelligence

## Houston AI competitive landscape

### Current footprint and built-in leverage
Leon Coe’s current ecosystem already has two rare assets that most “AI consultants” in the region lack: (a) a recurring community touchpoint and (b) a portfolio of speaking + training touchpoints that span business, cybersecurity-adjacent groups, education, and local organizations. Leon’s own speaking page lists **twenty-five-plus engagements** and describes his focus as “practical AI adoption, enterprise transformation, and building communities,” with Houston-based entries (e.g., IFMA Young Professionals, InfraGard Houston, corporate training) alongside broader media appearances.

The Houston AI Club has multiple “proof” signals that can be converted directly into authority and enterprise trust:
- It operates **monthly in-person meetups** with a consistent agenda format (check-in/networking → presentations/demos → Q&A).
- It runs **weekly virtual Lightning Lessons every Thursday at 10:30 AM Central**, creating an always-on cadence that can be repurposed into content and lead nurturing.
- Platform signals show scale and momentum: the Meetup group displays **2,470 members** and **4.8 rating with 291 ratings**, with large RSVPs for recent events.
- The upcoming March meetup listing notes **“over 130 guests” at the last meetup** and reinforces the “largest AI group” positioning, with a structured schedule and named talks.

This is a meaningful moat because most competing “AI communities” in the area are either (1) broadly technical but not executive-facing, (2) global/virtual-first rather than Houston-first, or (3) education/certification-first rather than implementation + transformation-first.

### Key Houston AI institutions and “authority nodes”
A Houston-first dominance strategy is easiest when it aligns with the city’s existing “authority nodes,” then becomes the bridge between them.

Academic and research credibility anchors:
- **Rice University** positions AI and computing as a cross-disciplinary focus; its **Ken Kennedy Institute** explicitly frames its mission around AI and computing research and enabling “transformative use” across disciplines.
- **University of Houston** presents an “AI at UH” hub with faculty researchers, courses, and research funding across colleges.
- **Bauer Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Institute** explicitly describes industry collaboration and research output as goals.
- **UTHealth Houston AI Hub** positions healthcare as “at the forefront” of AI transformation and describes education/research offerings and collaborations.

Innovation ecosystem “convening power” anchors:
- **Houston Exponential** describes its mission as championing and connecting the Greater Houston innovation ecosystem.
- **Ion District** states it is powered by Rice University and serves as a centerpiece for Houston’s innovation corridor at 4201 Main St.

Regional “AI readiness” narrative tailwind:
An evidence-backed narrative matters for authority-building pitches, local press hooks, and enterprise urgency. A Rice Kinder Institute analysis summarizing Brookings Metro’s work says Houston was labeled one of 28 “star hubs” for AI readiness and ranked 16th in that analysis, while also highlighting the need to “ramp up” innovation and startups. Brookings describes “Star Hubs” as a second echelon with “top-tier talent, research, and enterprise uptake.”

### Competing AI communities and meetups in Houston
For Houston authority dominance, the main competitors are not necessarily consulting firms—they’re the community aggregators that sit on attention and relationships.

High-signal local groups (positioning summary):
- **Houston Artificial Intelligence Meetup** positions as broad “anyone interested” AI coverage, explicitly not focused on one sub-area (e.g., ML vs DL).
- **Houston Machine Learning** positions around learning + networking and advertises 1:1 career coaching/business consulting plus recording distribution.
- **Houston Data Science** is explicitly education-first and instructor-led: it emphasizes fundamentals of Python/data science/ML and points to its founder.
- **Energy Analytics and Data Science** positions as practitioner networking, partners with other groups, and has large membership (2,769 shown) with events at the Ion Prototyping Lab—meaning it already sits near major innovation infrastructure.
- **Global AI Houston** positions as a local chapter of a worldwide community, with workshops and tech talks; its chapter page shows modest local scale compared to top Houston groups (e.g., 57 members shown on the chapter page) but connects to global branding.
- **Houston AI** positions as a nonprofit forum across industry, research, and institutions, emphasizing responsible adoption, collaboration, and “AI for everyone.”

Named organizers and leaders (useful for partnership or competitive mapping):
- **Steven Byrnes** is listed as an organizer of the Houston Artificial Intelligence Meetup.
- **Ted Petrou** is identified as the founder of Houston Data Science and is associated with **Dunder Data**.
- **Mark Kerzner** is listed as the organizer of The Houston Machine Learning Group.
- **Sanjoy Paul** is quoted in the Kinder Institute analysis as executive director of Rice Nexus and a co-founder of Houston AI (nonprofit).

### AI firms and consulting competitors targeting Houston search demand
Houston search results for “AI consultant” / “AI consulting” queries are currently dominated by generic local landing pages and IT-adjacent firms, often positioning around “strategy + implementation,” tool deployment, automation, or custom development:
- **Trenegy** positions “AI strategy and roadmap,” emphasizing “leverag[ing] AI realistically,” plus process/policy management.
- **PennComp** explicitly targets “Houston SMBs” with practical AI workflow use cases (HR/finance/security, etc.).
- **App Maisters** positions across AI strategy/governance to implementation, listing Microsoft Copilot/Salesforce Einstein and “AI Centers of Excellence” language—more enterprise IT framing.
- **7T** targets “Houston AI development services,” emphasizing ML, multimodal learning, and integration of common AI tools into business infrastructure.
- **Infonaligy** positions around deploying Microsoft Copilot, ML solutions, and AI-powered automation “across the Greater Houston area.”
- **Octaria** positions “tailored AI solutions” including agentic AI and predictive analytics.

A key observation: these competitors mostly compete on *service menus* and *tool keywords*—not on public proof loops (community, events, executive cohorts) plus a coherent “Houston AI authority” narrative.

### Authority gaps Leon can exploit
Houston has “many AI things,” but authority is fragmented. The clearest exploitable gaps are:

**Gap: cross-industry translation layer.** Houston’s economy is structurally cross-industry (energy, healthcare, logistics, aerospace), and the “readiness” narrative Brookings/Kinder highlights is tied to those industries—yet most meetups are either generic tech or domain-specific (energy analytics, data science) rather than “executive translation across Houston’s flagship sectors.”

**Gap: executive operating models, not “AI education.”** Many groups teach skills; fewer teach “how decisions get made” (governance, risk, ROI, vendor strategy, org change). That is exactly the positioning Leon’s speaking page claims (“enterprise transformation”) and Amplified Exec explicitly sells (boardroom/clarity framing, frameworks, action plan templates).

**Gap: visible proof of implementation in Houston.** A lot of consulting landing pages are “we do AI” statements. The opportunity is to publish Houston-specific implementation artifacts: procurement checklists, vendor evaluation templates, “playbooks,” and post-mortems that prove operational rigor. Amplify already markets playbook-style assets (e.g., CodeAlign playbook link; engineering case study positioning; blog playbooks).

### Search result dominance opportunities
The SERPs show two practical opportunities:

**Owning intent-heavy local commercial queries (“AI consulting Houston,” “AI consultant Houston”).** These queries currently surface multiple mid-authority vendor pages and directories. 
A focused Houston-first SEO program can target:
- “AI consultant Houston” (personal service intent)
- “AI strategy Houston” (exec intent)
- “AI training for leadership Houston” (workforce intent)
- “AI agents Houston” (technical/innovation intent)

**Owning the “Houston AI” entity cluster without confusion.** There are *multiple* similarly named entities in-market:
- “Houston AI Club” (the community you already run).
- “Houston AI” (nonprofit forum).
- “Houston.AI” (unrelated justice automation tooling). 
This creates a naming-ambiguity environment where Knowledge Panels, “AI Overviews,” and brand queries can leak traffic unless your entity signals are clean and consistent. 

## Regional authority domination strategy for Houston

### How to dominate a regional technical niche
A realistic Houston-first “authority domination” approach is not volume-based; it’s *infrastructure-based*. The engine is:

**Control the convening layer (events) + control the interpretation layer (content) + control the implementation layer (case studies) + control the discoverability layer (local SEO + entity signals).**

Houston’s macro narrative supports this. Major institutions and analyses emphasize that AI readiness and adoption are accelerating, but coordination and innovation depth still lag—creating room for a credible operator to become the “translation + execution hub.”

### Hyper-local SEO strategy for “AI Houston,” “AI consultant Houston,” and similar
Local SEO is not mysterious, but it is operationally strict. Google’s own Business Profile guidance emphasizes completeness and accuracy, and local ranking is driven primarily by **relevance, distance, and prominence**. 

A Houston-first plan should implement all four layers below in parallel.

**Layer: local service pages with Houston-native specificity**
Build (or rebuild) tightly scoped landing pages targeting Houston intent, anchored by proof:
- “AI transformation for senior leaders in Houston” page tied to Amplify’s “Transformation” offer (AI readiness assessment, roadmap, capability building, ROI modeling, risk management, metrics).
- “AI engineering (agents, architecture, optimization) in Houston” page tied to Amplify’s “Engineering” offer (agentic workflows, production workflows, cost reduction claims, prompt optimization).
- “AI-driven development standards for Houston engineering teams” page tied to CodeAlign, explicitly linking to a playbook asset.

Each page must include Houston-specific references that competitors rarely execute well:
- Houston-based examples and constraints (regulated energy workflows, healthcare privacy, industrial safety, port logistics).
- A clearly defined “service area” and a consistent business address/region language.
- Embedded proof objects: clips from Houston AI club talks, published frameworks, and case-study summaries.

**Layer: event SEO and “event schema”**
Events are a hidden local SEO weapon. Google supports Event structured data to help people discover events in Search/Maps and related Google products. 
Houston AI Club already has consistent event structure and recurring cadence. 
Operationally:
- Publish each meetup as a permanent, indexable page with Event schema.
- Create a “Houston AI Events” hub page that aggregates all upcoming events, recaps, video, slides, and speaker bios.
- Use post-event recaps as internal-link magnets to your consulting offer pages.

**Layer: Google Business Profile**
If the end goal is enterprise contracts, many leads still start by “Googling the person/company.” A Business Profile is the gateway to Maps visibility and local discovery. 
Implement:
- An Amplify Intelligence Business Profile (service-area business if no public office).
- A separate Houston AI Club profile if it has a stable, legitimate location/venue relationship and compliance fits (avoid spammy category stuffing).
- Consistent categories, service descriptions, and weekly posting.

**Layer: authority backlinks from Houston institutions**
In local SEO, “prominence” is partly about web presence and references. 
Backlink targets that align with Houston authority nodes:
- Innovation ecosystem hubs (program listings, speaker pages). 
- University/community training references (workshops, guest lectures).
- Major event ecosystems (energy/industry conferences in Houston that already attract senior leaders).

### Google Knowledge Graph and entity authority optimization
Google’s position is explicit: **knowledge panels are automatically generated** and draw information from “various sources across the web,” and Knowledge Panels appear when Google has “enough information available on the open web.” 
That means your job is to create *clear, consistent, corroborated entity signals*, especially given Houston’s naming collisions (Houston AI vs Houston AI Club vs Houston.AI). 

Practical implementation checklist:
- Implement Organization markup (and LocalBusiness when appropriate). Google explicitly recommends including real-world presence signals (address/telephone) plus online presence (url/logo) and “sameAs” links. 
- Implement ProfilePage structured data for Leon’s bio page and key profiles; Google supports profile page structured data for people/organizations. 
- For blog posts, ensure author markup points to the canonical author identity; Google’s Article structured data guidance explicitly calls out author URL/profile page markup and “sameAs” as tools for disambiguation. 
- Build consistent “sameAs” graphs across all owned properties: Leon ↔ Amplify ↔ Houston AI Club ↔ AI-First Work ↔ Amplified Exec, plus LinkedIn and other social profiles.

A critical brand-risk note: “Amplify Intelligence” is also present as a different LinkedIn company entity (Melbourne-based) with a different domain, creating a disambiguation risk you should actively manage with schema and consistent naming (e.g., “Amplify Intelligence (Houston AI Consulting)”). 
Also, “Amplify” is a widely known education company with its own AI program content, creating another naming-adjacent SERP competitor. 

### Local press and media leverage strategy
Local authority in Houston is strongly shaped by a small number of business and innovation outlets. Two high-leverage examples:
- **InnovationMap** positions itself as a leading voice of innovation in Houston and continuously publishes Houston innovation stories. 
- **Houston Chronicle** is actively covering AI developments (including Houston-specific AI manufacturing and tools). Recent reporting includes Apple’s Houston AI-related expansion and an AI tool the Chronicle launched for civic meeting monitoring. 

A Houston-first press program should be built around three repeatable angles:

**Angle: Houston as an AI manufacturing and infrastructure hub**
Local narratives are currently rich: Apple’s Houston footprint and AI-related manufacturing/training expansion is recent news, and Reuters has covered AI server manufacturing and robotics activity tied to Houston facilities. 
Convert this into recurring commentary:
- Monthly “Houston AI Infrastructure Brief” (data centers, chips, manufacturing, energy constraints).
- Exec-facing content: what this means for workforce, security, and procurement.

**Angle: industry AI adoption in Houston’s flagship sectors**
Houston’s sector mix is a strategic advantage for authority building. The Kinder Institute analysis notes Houston’s readiness is driven partly by energy, healthcare, and aerospace engineering industries. 

**Angle: “practical governance, not hype”**
This is where an authority can differentiate: publish templates for governance, vendor evaluation, and risk management. Amplify’s own messaging already emphasizes “skip the hype and get real results,” “risk management,” and “performance metrics.” 

## Hybrid personal and company authority architecture

### The hybrid model that reinforces without cannibalizing
A stable “hybrid authority” model should treat Leon as the **human trust anchor** and Amplify Intelligence as the **delivery proof engine**.

Amplify’s current positioning naturally supports this separation:
- “Transformation” is framed as strategic advisory + hands-on training for senior leaders, including readiness assessment, roadmap, ROI modeling, risk management, and metrics. 
- “Engineering” emphasizes production-ready AI products, agentic workflows, architecture, prompt engineering, and cost reduction. 
- “CodeAlign” frames process standards for AI-driven development with a playbook. 
- “Coaching” is explicitly “1:1 AI coaching for leaders.” 

Meanwhile, Leon’s public platform can carry the “Houston’s AI Guy” identity and the civic/community narrative, supported by the speaking inventory. 

### Content ownership structure
A clean operating structure assigns content by *audience intent*, not by content type:

**Leon-owned surfaces (identity + trust + “point of view”)**
- LinkedIn: daily narrative and reading-time optimized posts (authority + distribution).
- “Houston AI Pulse” commentary: what local execs should do next.
- Media appearances and speaking clips: portable trust objects.
- “Executive memos”: short, sharp point-of-view pieces that say what others won’t say.

**Amplify-owned surfaces (proof + conversion + enterprise enablement)**
- Case studies and measurable outcomes (even if anonymized).
- Playbooks: AI readiness, vendor evaluation, governance, ROI modeling.
- Technical breakdowns for engineering leaders (agents, architecture, cost optimization).
- Lead-capture assets: executive briefings, workshop outlines, pre-read decks.

**Community-owned surfaces (Houston AI Club as trust layer)**
- Event pages, recaps, recordings, speaker highlights.
- Lightning Lessons archive and sign-up loop. 

**Program-owned surfaces (education and premium offerings)**
- AI-First Work: low-ticket education with templates/tools, clearly positioned as skill building (and explicitly “Powered by Houston AI Club”). 
- Amplified Exec: premium executive immersion with clear pricing and event details (May 15–17, 2026 in Houston at JW Marriott Houston Downtown) and tiered offerings ($18,500 / $24,500 / $36,000). 

### Cross-domain SEO reinforcement strategy
Because you operate multiple domains, you need “entity coherence” more than you need raw link-building.

Technical guardrails based on Google guidance:
- Use structured data to help Google understand people/organizations and connect “sameAs” references across profiles. 
- For articles/blog posts, implement clear author identity linking to a canonical profile page; Google explicitly recommends marking up internal author profiles. 

Operationally, implement a “hub-and-spoke” link model:
- Houston AI Club recap pages link to the talk topic’s “deep dive” on Amplify (or Leon), and those deep dives link back to the event archive.
- AI-First Work resources link outward to the canonical playbooks where public.
- Amplified Exec pages link to Leon’s canonical bio + Amplify’s enterprise transformation proof.

The objective is to make Google’s job easy: one person, one company, one community, one city—interlinked with consistent semantics. 

## Content surface area mapping and prioritization

### Ranked content surfaces by impact, speed, and authority multiplier potential
The rankings below assume: (a) LinkedIn remains primary, (b) you can record events reliably, and (c) one operator can repurpose systematically.

| Surface | Primary role | Impact on enterprise deals | Speed to traction | Authority multiplier logic | Primary owner |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| LinkedIn | Distribution + network effects | Very high | Fast | Feed attention compounds; comments/time-spent matter for ranking models (LinkedIn engineering discusses dwell time and time distribution in feed ranking). | Leon |
| Event pages + recaps (Houston AI Club site) | Local SEO + proof | High | Fast | Each event is a durable “proof object” + indexable local signal; recurring events can be structured for discovery. | Houston AI Club |
| Meetup listings | Top-of-funnel attendance | Medium | Fast | Meetup ratings/member counts are social proof and can drive consistent RSVPs. | Houston AI Club |
| Amplify site: blog + playbooks | Conversion + credibility | Very high | Medium | “Helpful, reliable, people-first content” and author clarity support search performance, especially for high-stakes business topics. | Amplify |
| YouTube | Long-term discoverability | High | Medium | YouTube emphasizes satisfying viewers; search/discovery systems track viewer behavior and satisfaction—not just metadata. | Leon + Houston AI Club |
| Newsletter (audience capture) via Substack | Owned audience | High | Medium | Converts attention into direct reach; Leon’s newsletter exists and shows long tenure (launched years ago). | Leon |
| Guest podcasts (borrowed trust) via Spotify and others | Third-party validation | Medium–High | Medium | Existing appearances already demonstrate credibility; use as “proof snippets.” | Leon |
| GitHub repos | Technical proof | Medium | Slow | Strong for CTO/engineering trust; less direct for Houston execs unless tied to case studies. | Amplify |
| Local press features | Legitimacy + entity corroboration | High | Slow–Medium | News mentions feed the “open web” entity graph that Knowledge Panels draw from. | Leon + Amplify |

### Consulting client acquisition content strategy for Houston executives
To prioritize retainers and enterprise contracts, your content must do three jobs simultaneously:

**Job: signal “I can lead the change,” not just “I know the tools.”**  
Amplified Exec’s framing is already built for this: it explicitly positions itself as “not training” and “not a conference,” but a weekend designed to change how leaders “lead with AI,” with frameworks and a ninety-day plan. 

**Job: prove you can deliver measurable outcomes.**  
Amplify has multiple case-study-like assets and success stories:
- The “Bethany” story explicitly describes a structured coaching transformation and practical technical outcomes in weeks. 
- The Transformation page outlines an executive story and “key results” themes, and the Engineering page positions cost reductions and optimization case studies (though some linked PDFs require sign-in). 

**Job: localize to Houston’s decision context.**  
Houston executives sit inside industries that are AI-ready but operationally complex (energy, healthcare, aerospace, logistics). 

#### Case study frameworks that convert enterprise buyers
Use a consistent template so every proof asset feels “board-ready.” The format below is designed to become a slide deck, a blog post, and a LinkedIn narrative.

Case Study Pattern:
- **Context:** industry + operational constraints (regulatory, safety, privacy, legacy systems).
- **Trigger:** why now (cost pressure, cycle time, emissions, customer experience).
- **Decision:** the “model/tool strategy” and governance posture (what you chose not to do matters).
- **Intervention:** workshops, pilot build, enablement, operating model.
- **Outcome:** quantified ROI + time saved + risk reduced.
- **Institutionalization:** what became repeatable (playbooks, training, metrics).
- **Houston relevance:** why this worked in Houston’s environment (talent, vendors, partners).

Amplify’s own “Transformation” offer already enumerates the right components (readiness assessment, roadmap, ROI modeling, risk management, metrics). 

#### Content types that close retainers
A Houston-first retainer engine should be built around three recurring content series:

**Executive series: “AI operating model for Houston”**
- Governance and risk management briefings (vendor evaluation, policy, KPIs).
- CFO-friendly ROI frameworks (time-to-value, automation leverage curves).

Amplify already markets “risk management,” “ROI modeling,” and “performance metrics” as focus areas—turn those into public executive briefs. 

**Technical authority series: “Agents and workflows that actually ship”**
- Agent architecture breakdowns.
- Data readiness and evaluation pipelines.
- Cost optimization playbooks.

Amplify’s Engineering positioning emphasizes production workflows, model-centric cost reduction, and agentic workflows. 

**Houston-specific industry series**
Pick three “Houston-native” vertical wedges where authority can compound:

- **Energy and industrials:** Houston’s energy ecosystem is massive; the Kinder Institute notes thousands of energy-related firms in the metro and Houston’s clean-tech growth. 
- **Healthcare and life sciences:** **Texas Medical Center** describes itself as the world’s largest medical complex; UTHealth also actively runs an AI Hub. 
- **Logistics and trade:** **Port Houston** reports ranking first in U.S. foreign waterborne tonnage and provides cargo/value statistics—this supports a supply-chain AI wedge. 
- **Aerospace and space tech:** **NASA Johnson Space Center** is explicitly located in Houston and positions itself as a major hub of human exploration. 

## Authority flywheel system and automation opportunities

### Community-to-consulting flywheel design
The flywheel should be engineered as a pipeline, not a vibe:

**Community visibility → trust assets → problems surfaced → executive conversion path → Amplify contract.**

Houston AI Club already has built-in mechanics that can be upgraded into a lead system:
- Speaker and sponsor application flows exist on event pages. 
- Monthly meetups include “what’s new in AI this month,” which can become a consistent executive briefing artifact. 

Practical flywheel mechanics:
1. **Event RSVP segmentation:** ask one question at registration: “What best describes you?” (executive / operator / builder / student).  
2. **Executive after-event path:** offer a “Houston Executive AI Brief” follow-up (one-page summary + invitation to a short private roundtable).  
3. **Private roundtable conversion:** a monthly “Exec AI Office Hours” (invite-only, capped).  
4. **Paid diagnostic:** convert roundtable conversations into a “Readiness + ROI Sprint” sale.  
5. **Retainer:** pitch a ninety-day roadmap + implementation support retainer (Align incentives to business outcomes).

This is aligned with Amplify’s existing offer stack: strategic advisory + hands-on training, plus 1:1 coaching for leaders. 

### Authority flywheel content engine
Your repeatable content engine should “atomize” every high-effort asset:

**Event talk → transcript → three LinkedIn posts → one blog → one YouTube longform → six short clips → newsletter → playbook update.**

Why this works with platform mechanics:
- LinkedIn ranking systems explicitly incorporate time distribution/dwell-time style signals in feed ranking models (per LinkedIn engineering discussion). 
- YouTube discovery emphasizes long-term viewer satisfaction and uses signals like watch time and viewer behavior. 
- Google’s guidance prioritizes “helpful, reliable, people-first content” and E-E-A-T qualities; the Quality Rater Guidelines emphasize trust as central. 

### Automation and AI scaling opportunities
With one operator, automation is not optional—it’s the operating system.

High-leverage automation layers:
- **Agent-driven research briefs:** weekly Houston AI brief pulling (a) local news, (b) regulatory/policy shifts, and (c) major product/platform changes, then generating (1) an executive summary and (2) a “talking points” sheet.
- **Video clipping:** automatically generate shorts from every Lightning Lesson and monthly meetup recording; publish with consistent titling and topic taxonomy. 
- **Content repurposing pipeline:** transcript → quote bank → post drafts optimized for “read time” (hooks, line breaks, concrete takeaways). 
- **Authority tracking dashboards:**  
  - Local SEO rank tracking for “AI consultant Houston,” “AI strategy Houston,” etc. (monitor prominence and query-level improvements). 
  - Search Console + analytics dashboards for which posts drive contact form conversions ( align to “Book a Call” flow on Amplify pages). 
- **Entity hygiene monitoring:** alerts for entity confusion (e.g., “Amplify Intelligence” name collision) and consistency checks across profiles. 

## Execution blueprint and twelve-month roadmap

### Weekly and monthly operating cadence for two people
This cadence is designed around your real constraints: one authority figure + one primary operator.

Weekly cadence (repeatable)
**Leon (authority figure)**
- One long-form “pillar” per week (either a Lightning Lesson or a talk segment). 
- Three LinkedIn posts derived from the pillar (one executive, one technical, one Houston-local).
- Ten “high-signal comments” on relevant Houston leaders’ LinkedIn posts (executives, innovation orgs, university AI initiatives).

**Operator (automation specialist)**
- Record + transcribe the pillar and create the clip set.
- Publish: one blog recap (Amplify site) + one YouTube upload + shorts.
- Update SEO: internal links, event recaps, schema, and the “Houston AI hub” page.

Monthly cadence (repeatable)
- **Monthly Houston AI Club meetup** as the flagship content capture. 
- **Monthly executive roundtable** (invite-only) one week after the meetup.
- **Monthly “Houston AI Index” post**: summarize adoption signals, major local deals, and implications.

Quarterly cadence (repeatable)
- One “Houston flagship sector” executive workshop (Energy / Healthcare / Logistics / Aerospace).
- Publish two public case studies (anonymized if needed).
- Refresh your Knowledge Graph signals and local SEO assets. 

### Twelve-month roadmap with KPIs
This roadmap assumes start in early March 2026, anchored by existing scheduled events (e.g., March meetup on March 5, 2026, and the Amplified Exec dates in May). 

#### Months one through three
Primary objective: **Houston dominance foundations + enterprise pipeline creation**

Operating objectives:
- Launch Houston-first commercial pages on Amplify aligned to core offers (Transformation/Engineering/CodeAlign). 
- Stand up Business Profile(s) and complete local SEO basics (categories, services, posting cadence). 
- Turn every meetup into a published recap + clip series; build an archive. 
- Establish “Exec AI Office Hours” monthly.

KPIs:
- Two enterprise discovery calls per week attributable to Houston channels.
- One new Houston enterprise pilot proposal per month.
- Local SEO: measurable rank movement for at least five “AI Houston” intent queries. 
- Content engine: one pillar/week and a consistent clip pipeline. 

#### Months four through six
Primary objective: **proof consolidation + premium program amplification**

Operating objectives:
- Publish at least four enterprise-grade case studies (two transformation, two engineering/process), using a standardized board-ready framework. 
- Use Amplified Exec as an apex authority object (premium pricing + curated cohort + framework output). 
- Formalize partnerships with at least two Houston authority nodes (innovation district programming, university workshops, or adjacent communities).

KPIs:
- Two retainer clients (or equivalent enterprise contracts) in active delivery.
- Press mentions or guest features in at least two Houston innovation/news channels. 
- Event conversion: a measurable percent of meetup attendees entering an “executive follow-up” funnel.

#### Months seven through twelve
Primary objective: **statewide and national expansion without losing Houston dominance**

Operating objectives:
- Create a “Texas AI executive network” extension using Houston as the flagship brand (Houston events remain the center; statewide is distributed via partnerships and guest appearances).
- Target major Houston industry conferences for speaking slots and sponsorship leverage (e.g., AI in Oil & Gas Conference in April 2026 in Houston draws senior leaders and has explicit AI governance/ROI themes). 
- Scale the content engine into a “research-to-LinkedIn” loop: monthly reports → weekly commentary → daily distribution.

KPIs:
- Houston search dominance: first-page presence across multiple high-intent queries (consulting + training + executive AI). 
- Authority signals: consistent Knowledge Panel presence and reduced entity confusion through structured data and corroboration. 
- Business: predictable pipeline with quarterly enterprise contracts plus recurring retainers.

A Houston-first focus is particularly defensible because Houston is simultaneously (a) positioned as a nationally recognized AI “star hub” in major readiness analyses and (b) still described by local research as needing stronger coordination and innovation depth—leaving room for a credible operator-led authority network to become the default “translation + execution” center.
